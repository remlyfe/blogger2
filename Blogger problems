Blogger problems

Git and Github issues I encountered during this process

1. For some reason I had problems getting rake db:migrate to actually update the db. After a quick google search I found the answer and it worked fine.

2. I got an error when I first tried to commit my changes that said 'commit'' was not a valid file or command. I don't remember the exact wording because I forgot to save it.

The solution was to use double quotes instead of single quotes. Go figure. 

3. Git Push Request Rejected 
	
	When I tried to push my work to git hub I got an error message like this:

	! [rejected]        feature/my_feature_branch -> feature/my_feature_branch (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://git@github.com.com:xxxx/myproject.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull')
hint: before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

I tried to rebase the repo as suggested here:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20467179/git-push-rejected-non-fast-forward

But for whatever reason that didn't solve the issue.

I tried a couple of git pull, git fetch, git merge suggestions I found on stack overflow without success. After about an hour or so through this rabbit hole I decided to delete the repo and start fresh. 

Burning the whole thing down and starting fresh isn't a solid long term strategy but I figure since I'm the only user and there was no information to lose it should be ok this time.

Here is a link to the step by step for this:

https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/

**Note that I had to use this command first:
	
	git rm -rf .git

This removes the original .git file and allows you to start fresh, free from additional errors.

4. Kept getting this error:

ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken in ArticlesController#create

Solution

I added this code to the beginning of the ArticlesController class in the articles_controller.rb file:

skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token

found the solution here - https://codedump.io/share/AGtpmiaWIK2k/1/rails-actioncontrollerinvalidauthenticitytoken-when-adding-a-image

**Need to solve the problem instead of patching it

5. flash.notice does not show after an udpate

6. SQLITE3::SQLEXCEPTION: TABLE ALREADY EXISTS
Could not complete rake db:migrate process to start the tagging section because I had two Create Comments files in the migration file. They were identical so I deleted the older one. 

That's where this error popped up. I initially tried to drop the table and recreate it with this code in the migration file above the CreateComments code:

class RemoveComments < ActiveRecord::Migration
	def change
		drop_table :comments
	end
end

I got the idea from this thread on stack overflow:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18961900/error-to-migrate-db-rails

Unfortunately that also did not work. I eventually decided to try deleting both CreateComments files. That worked just fine. Not really sure why.
